This pertains to part 2, but is based on the example from yesterday.
I am trying to run this in RStudio console:
- source('~/nagalakshmi_count_table.R', "do you see me")

My first question is, how do you pass arguments to r script from console command line, or
should I be doing this a different way?

```{r}
### 
paste(commandArgs())

### Extract and Normalize Data

## Extract data

# get and look at counts raw data
nagalakshmi_counts <- read.table("~/nagalakshmi_count_table.txt", header=T)

View(nagalakshmi_counts)

# make genes column row names instead
rownames(nagalakshmi_counts) <- nagalakshmi_counts$gene
nagalakshmi_counts <- nagalakshmi_counts[, -1]


## Normalize data

# define normalize_counts function
# counts is treated as a metaparameter

normalize_counts <- function(counts, methodToApply, removeZeros=T) {
  
  # Get rid of rows whose columns sum to zero by default. Note that
  # p-values shouldn't change, but fdr will if you remove zeros.
  # Removing zeros is recommended primarily for runtime purposes.
  if (removeZeros) {
    counts$sum <- apply(counts, MARGIN = 1, FUN = sum)
    counts <- counts[counts$sum != 0,]
    counts <- counts[, -5]
  }
  
  # loop through columns and apply normalization method to each row
  applytocounts <- sapply(counts, methodToApply)
  normalized_counts <- counts
  for (i in 1:dim(counts)[2]) {
    normalized_counts[,i] <- counts[,i] / applytocounts[i]
  }
  
  # plot and return normalized_counts variable
  boxplot(normalized_counts, outline = F)
  normalized_counts
}


## Examples with two different methods (median and upper quartile)
## Note that in both examples, method is defined to remove zeros
## for calculating normalization, regardless of whether the zero
## rows are left in place or removed from the output data.

# median normalization - not a good method
median_nonzeros = function(x) {median(x[x != 0])}
normalize_counts(nagalakshmi_counts, median_nonzeros)

# upper quartile normalization - better
upper_quartile_nonzeros = function(x) {quantile(x[x != 0], .75)}
normalize_counts(nagalakshmi_counts, upper_quartile_nonzeros)
```
